Changelog for s6-networking.

In 2.3.0.2
----------

 - Bugfix release.


In 2.3.0.1
----------

 - Bugfix release.


In 2.3.0.0
----------

 - Added this NEWS file. :)
 - Major types overhaul to make them more POSIXly correct:
compatibility with skalibs-2.5.0.0.
 - Fixed the "s6-tls[cd] does not die and the zombie application
hangs around" bug. (It's really a workaround for a TCP bug.)
 - s6-tls[cd] ported to bearssl-0.3. Client certificates still
not supported with BearSSL because Thomas is slooooooow at
implementing the high-level server functions I asked him for :P
 - The meaning of the -Y option in s6-tlsd has changed: it now
means "ask for an optional client certificate". Only valid with
a LibreSSL backend for now.
